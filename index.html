<h2 class="section-two__title">About Me</h2>
<p class="section-two__desc">As a student member of the Institution's Innovation Council (IIC) at AAA College of Engineering and Technology, I work with a team of peers and mentors to foster a culture of innovation and entrepreneurship on campus. I have participated in multiple hackathons, workshops, and ideation sessions, where I have honed my skills in problem-solving, design thinking, and collaboration.

    I am also a former campus ambassador for Cybernaut, a platform that connects students with industry experts and mentors. In this role, I helped to organize and promote online events, webinars, and courses for my fellow students, and gained valuable insights into the latest trends and technologies in the web development field.
    
    I am pursuing a Bachelor of Engineering degree in Computer Science, with a keen interest in full stack web development. I have completed a bootcamp on the basics of JavaScript programming, where I learned how to use various frameworks and tools to create efficient and responsive web applications. My goal is to become a proficient full stack developer and contribute to the technology industry with my knowledge and passion. I am always eager to learn new skills and explore new opportunities, and I would love to connect with you.
